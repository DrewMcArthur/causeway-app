			<p>Hi, I'm Drew. I spent a week writing all the code for this website from scratch.  I pay for the hosting myself, so everyone can benefit from this for free.  All the code is hosted on <a href=''>github</a>, if you're curious.  I am a college student, so any help is much appreciated at my <a href=''>go fund me page</a>.</p>
